Life Cycle of a Data Science Project:

1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature selection
4. Model building
5. Model Deployment


Data Analysis:
In Data Analysis we analyze to find out the following stuff
    1. Missing Values
    2. All the Numerical Values
    3. Distribution of the Numerical Values
    4. Categorical Variables
    5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
    6. Outliers
    7. Relationships between independent and dependent features(Sale Price)

Feature Engineering:
In feature engineering i'll be covering the following steps
    1. Handling missing values (w.r.t Categorical and numerical features)
    2. Handling temporal variables
    3. Categorical variables: remove rare labels
    4. Standardise the value of the variables to some range
